# Chip Design Project – HC12 Microcontroller

This project simulates a full chip design using assembly on the HC12 microcontroller platform. Developed and tested using CodeWarrior with integrated simulator support.

## 🔧 Main Features

- Custom interrupt handling
- Memory-mapped I/O
- Initialization routines for peripherals
- Simulated execution using HC12 simulator

## 📁 Key Files

- `main.asm` – Core assembly program
- `derivative.inc` – MCU register definitions
- `Full_Chip_Simulation.ini` – Project and simulator config 

## 💻 Tools

- CodeWarrior for HC12 microcontroller board and Eebot

## 🚀 Run

This project is intended for use within CodeWarrior. Use the provided `.mcp` and `.ini` files to simulate execution.
